        <h2>About Fitness</h2>

            not limited to mental acuity, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, body
            composition, and flexibility. While there is a standard definition for fitness, each individual can have
            their own personal understanding of what fitness means. To some individuals, being fit means the ability to
            complete a marathon or lift a lot of weight. To another, it could mean walking around the block without
            becoming short of breath. Your definition of fitness will be influenced by your interests, physical
            abilities, and goals. No matter what the definition, it is important for every individual to keep their
            personal definition of fitness within a healthy framework This means you should have realistic expectations
            and maintain balance and moderation in all aspects of life. Set small , attainable goals and avoid giving
            too much power to the numerical measurements of fitness. This can help your journey to fitness seem much
            less daunting and much more enjoyable.</p>
